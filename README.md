In this assignment, you will use NetLogo or a general purpose language to create an agent-based model (ABM) of a complex phenomenon. You will conduct this work as part of a group (of three peo- ple). This assignment is intended to give you greater freedom to apply the knowledge and skills you are acquiring in this subject to a domain of interest to you.

The objectives of this assignment are to gain experience in:• identifying a research question of scientific or policy interest;• designing an appropriate ABM and experiments to address a specific question;• communicating the design of your model, and the results of your investigation;• collaborating over an extended period of time to execute a substantial piece of work.

Background

Agent-based models can be used to model a broad range of systems in the real world. You are free to choose a topic of interest to you for this assignment. While the work you submit (proposal, report and model code) must be that of your group, I am happy for topics and questions to be discussed with me, with each other, in class, in tutorials, and on the Discussion Board.

To get you started, a list of possible topics are provided at the end of this specification. Note that any of these example topics could each be used as the basis for many possible questions, and could potentially lead to very complex models. However, bear in mind the time constraint on this project: You should start by aiming for a single question that can be addressed using a relatively simple model. It is far more important to address a simple question well than to address a complex ques- tion poorly. If your initial question and model go well, you can always elaborate your question and extend your model.

In terms of model complexity: as a baseline, your model should involve some form of non-trivial agent behaviour and interaction between agents, such that you can identify and measure some in- teresting emergent behaviour of the system.

Your tasks

1. Identify a question and review relevant literature and existing models;2. Write a proposal describing your question and proposed approach (first deadline); 3. Design and implement your model (in NetLogo or a general purpose language);4. Design and execute a series of experiments using your model;5. Write a report describing your model and findings (second deadline).

Procedure and assessment

<ul>

 <li>This assignment is to be completed in groups of three.</li>

 <li>There are two deadlines for this project, listed above: a proposal, and a final report (plus modelcode). The suggested structure for each submission is outlined below.</li>

 <li>Late submissions will incur a penalty of 2 marks for every day (or part thereof) after the dead- line. If there is a valid reason that you require an extension, email Nic well before the due date to discuss this.</li>

 <li>You should submit you both your proposal and your report via Canvas LMS. All files should contain the names and student numbers of all group members.</li>

 <li>We encourage use of the Piazza Discussion Board to discuss and ask questions about this project; however, all submitted work must be your group’s own work.</li>

 <li>This project counts for 40% of your total marks in this subject. Marks will be awarded accord- ing to the criteria described below.ProposalYour proposal should be 2 pages outlining: (a) your research question; (b) a brief summary of pre- vious research relevant to this question; (c) your proposed approach to addressing this question, in the form of a draft ODD description. Your proposal counts for 5% of your total marks in this subject.ReportYour report should be 8–12 pages, incorporating the following components:

  <ul>

   <li>Introduction: Motivate and describe your question and summarise relevant research on this topic.</li>

   <li>Model design: Describe your model using the ODD framework; this should be sufficiently de- tailed to enable someone else to implement your model.</li>

   <li>Methods: Describe the experiments used to analyse your model’s behaviour and address your question; this should be sufficiently detailed to enable someone else to recreate your analysis.</li>

   <li>Results: Provide a qualitative and quantitative summary of your model’s behaviour, including tables or figures as appropriate.</li>

   <li>Discussion: Interpret your results: how do they answer the question that motivated your project. Put your results in a broader context: what are the implications of your findings. Describe the strengths, limitations and potential future directions of this work. This is also the place to re- flect on things that may have gone well, or less well, in carrying out the assignment, and briefly summarise what you have learned from the experience.Your report counts for 35% of your total marks in this subject. Note that you are free to reuse any content from your proposal in your report.CodeYou may implement your model in NetLogo or a general purpose language (eg, Python, Java or C++). If you choose to use a general purpose language to implement your model, you are welcome to use an agent-based modelling library / framework such as Mesa, Repast or MASON (though note that the teaching team may not be able to provide support for these libraries).Your model code will not contribute to your mark for this assignment, but it is a hurdle requirement, in that it must be submitted (in well structured and clearly documented from) in order to obtain a passing mark for the assignment.</li>
